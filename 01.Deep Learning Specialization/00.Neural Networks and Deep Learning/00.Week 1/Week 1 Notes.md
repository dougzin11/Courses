# What is a Neural Network?
- A Neural Network consists of many processing units (called nodes) that are interconnected and organized into layers.
- Each node can be connected to several nodes from different layers (beneath or above it), sending the information across the whole Neural Network.
- For each connection, the Network will assign weights - numbers/values that are optimized through Gradient Descent.

An example of a simple Neural Network architecture is given in the image below.
